# GameOfLife
This was a project I did for my computer science class. The objective was to knock out a quick project so the code is a little messier than my other projects.

Cell_Images contains a huge gif split into hundreds of pngs for easy playing.

Song.wav is of course a song that gets played in the program.

Cell_Bio is a folder full of gag cell descriptions that you will see being used in the game.
